      <h2>Scenario for AI Use Case Prioritisation</h2>
      <p>
        GreenGrain Foods Ltd is a mid-sized food manufacturing company experiencing operational inefficiencies and increased competition in the market.
        They have identified a number of potential AI use cases but currently lack a structured way to evaluate them for delivery.
      </p>

      <h3>The Task</h3>
      <p>
        Design and apply a prioritisation framework to help GreenGrain Foods decide which AI initiatives to focus on.
        This solution will be presented to a wide range of audiences with technical abilities.
