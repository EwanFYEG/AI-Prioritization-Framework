    <h2>Scenario for AI Use Case Prioritisation</h2>
    <p>
      GreenGrain Foods Ltd is a mid-sized food manufacturing company experiencing operational inefficiencies and increased competition in the market.
      They have identified a number of potential AI use cases but currently lack a structured way to evaluate them for delivery.
    </p>

    <h3>The Task</h3>
    <p>
      Design and apply a prioritisation framework to help GreenGrain Foods decide which AI initiatives to focus on.
      This solution will be presented to a wide range of audiences with technical abilities.
    </p>

    <h3>The Prioritization Matrix</h3>

    <h3>Key Insights & Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>High Feasibility & Low Cost</strong> â†’ Ideal for Quick Wins.</li>
      <li><strong>High Feasibility & High Cost</strong> â†’ Strategic, but needs investment.</li>
      <li><strong>Cost & Business Value show inverse correlation</strong> â†’ Not all costly projects drive strong value.</li>
      <li><strong>Feasibility strongly links to Strategic Alignment</strong> â†’ Well-aligned initiatives tend to be easier to execute.</li>
